# Loom Docker Listener
Docker Container to monitor other containers logs and send them to Loom.

This container uses [Filebeat docker](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/filebeat/current/running-on-docker.html "File Beat") base image (5.5.0)

## Run the container
<!-- ```shell
docker build -t <name> .
``` -->
This container when run will mount the host's docker container folder as read only. The mounted directory allows the monitor to have live feed on the log files of other Dockers on the same host machine.

Why not use `/var/run/docker.sock`? As we only need to monitor on the logs mounting the volume as `READ ONLY` keeps the host machine and the docker daemon safe.

```shell
docker run --name loom-collector-docker -e CUSTOMER_NAME=<customer name> --privileged -v /var/lib/docker/containers:/containers:ro loomsystems/loom-collector-docker
```
* `-v /var/lib/docker/containers:/containers:ro` this allows the docker to read the other containers logs. The host directory must be where all the docker containers are stored (normally /var/lib/docker/containers for Linux).
* `CUSTOMER_NAME` must be set for the container to send the logs to Loom.
